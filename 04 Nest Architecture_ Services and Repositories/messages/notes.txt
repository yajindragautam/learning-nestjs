Understanding Inversion Of Control

Why the Good case is Good

In Production
class MessagesService
- I need something that has a findOne, findAll and Create
  method to work currectly.

class MessagesRepository
- I can help you. I write to the hard disk, so I am a little slower.

When AUTOMATED Testing
class MessagesService
- I need something that has a findOne, findAll and Create
 method to work currectly.

 class FakeRepository
 - I can help you. I  do't actually write to the hard disk, so I run fast.

 Introduction to Dependency Injection
DI Container Flow
1) At setup, register all classes with the container.
2) Container will figure out what each dependancy each class has
3) We then ask the container to create an instance of a class for us.
4) Container creates all required dependancy and gives us the instance
5) Container will hold onto the created dependancy instances and reuse them if needed
